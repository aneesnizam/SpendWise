# SpendWise

SpendWise is a simple daily expense tracker app designed to help users monitor and manage their spending habits easily. The project is split into two parts:  
- **Frontend:** A React-based user interface for adding, editing, and viewing expenses.  
- **Backend:** A RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to handle data storage, user authentication, and email notifications.
